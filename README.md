# Mobile Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project uses Linear Regression to predict mobile phone prices based on various features such as RAM, storage, battery capacity, and more. The goal is to build a model that can effectively estimate the price range of a mobile device, aiding manufacturers and customers in understanding pricing trends.

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: Predict the price range of mobile phones based on key features.
- **Data**: A dataset containing specifications of various mobile devices.
- **Algorithm**: Linear Regression was applied to model the relationship between features and the price range.

## Steps Involved
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized relationships between features and mobile price.
3. **Model Training**: Trained a Linear Regression model to predict price ranges.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessed the model's accuracy using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.
